With the introduction of [Organization-based Billing](/docs/guides/platform/org-based-billing), we’re adding the ability to freely transfer projects between different organizations. Head to your [projects' general settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) to initiate a project transfer.

Source organization - the organization the project currently belongs to
Target organization - the organization you want to move the project to

## Pre-Requirements

- The target organization you want to move the project to needs to use [Organization-based Billing](/docs/guides/platform/org-based-billing).
- You need to be the owner of the source organization.
- You need to be at least a member of the target organization you want to move the project to.
- Projects with support tier addons cannot be transferred at this point. Please [open a support ticket](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new?category=billing&subject=Transfer%20project).

## Usage-billing and project addons

If you’re using a [Compute Add-On](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons), [Point-In-Time-Recovery](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery), [IPv4](/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address), [Log Drains](/docs/guides/platform/log-drains), [Advanced MFA](/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa/phone) or a [Custom Domain](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains), the source organization will still be charged for the time the add-on was active.
The charges are added at the end of your billing cycle.

The target organization will be charged at the end of the billing cycle for the remaining time in the billing cycle.
As the billing cycle from the source and target organization likely differ, the amounts can vary.

All project add-ons are charged usage-based at the end of your billing cycle, see [How billing works](/docs/guides/platform/org-based-billing).

Similarly, for other usage metrics such as database size, egress, image transformations and so on, the usage until the project transfer will be billed on the source organization and future usage will be added to the target organization once moved.

## Things to watch out for

- Transferring a project might come with a short 1-2 minute downtime if you're moving a project from a paid to a Free Plan.
- You could lose access to certain project features depending on the plan of the target organization, i.e. moving a project from a Pro Plan to a Free Plan.
- When moving your project to a Free Plan, we also ensure you’re not exceeding your two free project limit. In these cases, it is best to upgrade your target organization to Pro Plan first.
- You could have less rights on the project depending on your role in the target organization, i.e. you were an Owner in the previous organization and only have a Read-Only role in the target organization.

## Transfer to a different region

Note that project transfers are only transferring your projects across an organization and cannot be used to transfer between different regions. To move your project to a different region, see [migrating your project](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects#migrate-your-project).
